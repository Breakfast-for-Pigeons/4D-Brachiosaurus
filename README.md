## Requirements:

Innonex 4D Science  Brachiosaurus from Amazing Toys Ltd.

Raspberry Pi (including power supply, keyboard, mouse, speaker, and monitor).

Electronics:

 * breadboard
 * L293D chip
 *  2 tactile push buttons
 *  8 male-to-male jumper wires
 *  8 male-to-female jumper wires (You can get by with only 6. I used 2 to extend the wires of the motor)
 *  battery holder (one that will hold 4 AA batteries)

## Optional

Frtizing application: http://fritzing.org/

## Instructions

1) Connect the Rasberry Pi, Brachiosaurus motor, and electronics as shown in the image below. If you installed the Fritzing application, I included my 4D_Brachiosaurus.fzz file. Feel free to use it. NOTE: The image shows only 2 AA batteries. I actually used 4 AA batteries for this project.
