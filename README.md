Electronics:

 * breadboard
 * L293D chip
 *  2 tactile push buttons

## Optional

Frtizing application: http://fritzing.org/

## Instructions

1) Connect the Rasberry Pi, Brachiosaurus motor, and electronics as shown in the image below. If you installed the Fritzing application, I included my 4D_Brachiosaurus.fzz file. Feel free to use it. NOTE: The image shows only 2 AA batteries. I actually used 4 AA batteries for this project.
